# Friday Breakfast

Simple vertical mobile-first HTML5 game (works well as an "Add to Home Screen" iOS web app).

How to use
1. Copy these files to a GitHub repository.
2. In the repository Settings -> Pages, enable Pages (select the branch and folder where index.html lives).
3. Visit the Pages URL from an iPhone Safari, open the page, then use Share â†’ "Add to Home Screen".
4. Launch from the Home Screen to get the standalone app-like experience with the icon.

Notes
- The app includes Apple meta tags and an inline apple-touch-icon for a consistent icon on the iOS Home Screen.
- The game is designed for portrait (vertical) mobile screens.
- Joystick supports touch; you can also test with mouse on desktop.
